\section{About lawsuits}{

The lawsuits contemplated by this funtion have to be filed in a
Brazilian Tribunal de Justica (Justice Court). \code{\link[=download_cpopg]{download_cpopg()}}
finds the lawsuit in its state's online Sistema de Automacao de Justica
(Justice Automation System), solves the captcha withholding the
information, and collects the PDF.
